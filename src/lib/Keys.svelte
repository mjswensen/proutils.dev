<!-- TODO: takes a windows, linux, and mac variation,
  displays the correct one based on user agent -->
<script lang="ts">
  export let windows: string[];
  export let mac: string[];
  export let linux: string[];
</script>

<!-- 
  Other TODOs:

  - design a better home page
  - Make the under construction messages a banner but maybe not a component yet
  - design the textareas invalid state with action (previously what might have
    been a banner)
 -->
